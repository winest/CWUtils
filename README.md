## About CWUtils

CWUtils is a set of standalone APIs for developers to speed up their programming.<br />
The word "standalone" means almost all necessary functions are wrapped in a single file,
so it should be very easy to port them to other projects or learn how to implement things
on different languages and platforms.



###Main features:
- Wrap all frequently-used functions in a single file.
- Almost the same APIs provided for different programming languages and platforms.
- Most functions are optimized for Windows and focus on platforms since Windows 7,
  so you may see totally different implementation on Windows and Linux/Unix versions.
- Will maintain for a long time since it's widely used by myself



###Coding convention:
- Please refer to [Coding Convention] (https://github.com/winest/CWUtils/blob/master/CodingConvention.md)
